Hello! Is it me you're looking for? I am Yunyi Li, a Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems-Computational Data Science at [McCombs School of Business @ UT Austin](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu), advised by Professors [Maytal Saar-Tsechansky](https://maytals.com/) and [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/). I am also a [Good Systems](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems) researcher. I hold a master's degree in [Informatics](https://cs.uiowa.edu/informatics) and a bachelor's degree in [Business Analysis & Information Systems](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/undergraduate/majors/business-analytics-major) from [the University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/about-iowa). 

My research focuses on advancing trustworthy AI with the goal of maximizing the positive societal impact of social-technical systems while mitigating their potential harms. Motivated by the risks of overlooked label bias, part of my research examines its harmful effects and develops strategies to mitigate them, fostering data integrity in an increasingly data-dependent world. More broadly, my work bridges the domains of data integrity, algorithmic fairness, human-AI interaction, and interpretable machine learning, with the overarching goal of enhancing the trustworthiness of socio-technical systems to better serve both organizations and society.
