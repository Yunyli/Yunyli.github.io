Hello! Is it me you're looking for? I am Yunyi Li, a Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems-Computational Data Science at [McCombs School of Business @ UT Austin](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu), advised by professors [Maytal Saar-Tsechansky](https://maytals.com/) and [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/). I am also a [Good Systems](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems) researcher. I obtained my master's in [Information Science](https://cs.uiowa.edu/informatics) and my bachelor's in [Business Analysis & Information Systems](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/undergraduate/majors/business-analytics-major) from the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/about-iowa). 

My research focuses on advancing trustworthy AI with the goal of maximizing the positive societal impact of social-technical systems while mitigating their potential harms. As part of my work, I study the phenomenon of label bias for understanding how it can be harmful when overlooked, and  explore methods that aim to mitigate the harm from label bias and promote data integrity in an ever-growing data-dependent world. Generally speaking, my work lies at the intersection of data integrity, algorithmic fairness, human-AI interaction, and interpretable ML, with a unifying goal of advancing the trustworthiness of socio-technical systems and ultimately serving organizations and society in a responsible and lasting way.
