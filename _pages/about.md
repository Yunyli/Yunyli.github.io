Hello! Is it me you're looking for? I am Yunyi Li, a Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems-Computational Data Science at [McCombs School of Business @ UT Austin](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu), advised by Professors [Maytal Saar-Tsechansky](https://maytals.com/) and [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/). I am also a [Good Systems](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems) researcher. I hold a master's degree in [Informatics](https://cs.uiowa.edu/informatics) and a bachelor's degree in [Business Analysis & Information Systems](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/undergraduate/majors/business-analytics-major) from [the University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/about-iowa). 

My research focuses on advancing **trustworthy AI** with the goal of maximizing the positive societal impact of social-technical systems while mitigating their potential harms. Motivated by the risks of overlooking [**label bias**](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202408/noti2941/noti2941.html?adat=September%202024&trk=2941&pdfissue=202408&pdffile=rnoti-p1069.pdf&cat=none&type=.html), part of my research [characterizes its harmful effects](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/HCOMP/article/view/21994) and develops strategies to mitigate them, fostering data integrity in an increasingly data-dependent world. More broadly, my work bridges the domains of **data integrity**, **algorithmic fairness**, **human-AI interaction**, and **interpretable machine learning**, with the overarching goal of enhancing the trustworthiness of socio-technical systems to better serve both organizations and society.
